# Memory Master startup
[My Notes](notes.md)

The purpose of the project is to build a full front-to-back of a web page that allows users to play Memory. Daily parctice is essential to keep and health and focused mind. It can also be a fun way to incorporate word-image association for those trying to learn new concepts. This will allow for interactive and visual learning for those who feel that words on a page are not adaquate for their learning needs.

## Key Features
As it is still in the development phase, it will have a few preset grids and sets of images. Each person will need an account that will track their general performance. A new user will need to be able to create an account and have that infomations saved in a user database. Users will be able to compete against each other or play individually.


## Design Image
Here we can see a rough design of what our end product will look like. I plan on keeping the functionality quite simple initially to establish a functioning product. If there is additional time I may alter what the initial vision is.
